# How to use Goffaux-Lab
This is the lab's shared github space. We should upload any code and documents
that could be useful for anyone in the lab to be able to use.

## Overview of the workflow
Github repositories can then be **forked** between accounts (i.e. create a
copy) so that others can use them too. So you can **fork** a repository from
your personal github account the Goffaux-Lab account, or **fork** a repository
from Goffaux-Lab account to yours.

On your personal github account you can make changes to the repositories as you
please. These changes can easily be synchronised back to the Goffaux-Lab
account submitting a **pull request**.

If you're working on a **fork** of a repository on your personal account, and
meanwhile someone makes changes to the repository on the Goffaux-Lab account
(i.e. submits a **pull request** that is accepted), you can easily synchronise
your **fork** of the repository with the updated Goffaux-Lab account (this is
called **fetch-upstream**).
